## NOTE: ##

Please ignore the `config.xml` file, the Cordova CLI `config.xml` format has
been changing significantly, especially with the release of CLI 5.0, and this
`config.xml` file has not been updated to reflect those changes. It will not
work as written. It was originally created for use with PhoneGap CLI and has
not been updated for use with the current PhoneGap CLI system, either.
